# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 
In your Python script, import the NumPy library.
### Step 2: 
Define the matrix for which you want to find the inverse
### Step 3: 
 Define the Matrix
### Step 4: 
Find the Inverse
## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by: Yashvanth K
#RegisterNumber: 2311613
import numpy as np
A=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
inverse=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(inverse)
```
## Output:
